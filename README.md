# gomeme



gomeme is a cli for Control-M, based on
[Control-M Automation API](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/automation-api/9181/services-784100995.html)
and loosely inspired by [govc](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc).

## Usage

```
export GOMEME_ENDPOINT=https://.../automation-api
export GOMEME_CERT_DIR=~/certs
gomeme login -u toto
gomeme qr -n PRD*
...
```


Use the ```--dump``` option to output in a Go-like format. ```--json``` option outputs in json format.

Helps for commands can be accessed with ```-h```

Traffic received from ctm server can be dumped with ```--debug```

### SSL config

If GOMEME_ENDPOINT is using https, gomeme must be able to verify the identity of the server.
When the certificate of the server is signed by an unknown authority, that certificate should be placed under a folder 
referenced by SSL_CERT_DIR or GOMEME_CERT_DIR environment variable.

Typically,

1. create a certs folder
2. retrieve the server certificate using ```echo | openssl s_client -prexit -connect myserver:443 | openssl x509 > certs/out.pem```
3. ensure the server name in the certificate can be resolved (possibly, add it in etc/hosts)
4. from the certs folder, run ```c_rehash .``` (so that curl will be able to use --capath, though it does not seem mandatory)

SSL_CERT_DIR usually can be a column separated list of folders, but go (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35325) consider it
as a single folder. GOMEME_CERT_DIR environment variable can be used as an alternative to SSL_CERT_DIR (to avoid breaking
other tools).

openssl and go tls package do not validate certificates identically (it seems you need to trust the whole chain, including
the root CA, for openssl to work fine). As such, you may want to run 
```echo | openssl s_client -prexit -connect myserver:443 -showcerts``` 
and put the root CA certificate in your certs folder.

### Annotations

Annotations can be provided with the ```--subject``` and ```--description``` parameters. ```deploy.put``` and ```job.modify```
requires an annotation to be set even if audit is not activated on server side.


## Commands

### login

Get a token for a user. Writes it into a .token file in the current directory.

The password must be provided either through the GOMEME_PASSWORD environment variable, or
through the terminal.

User defaults to $USER if not specified.

```
gomeme login --user toto
```

### qr

list qrs

```
gomeme qr --name PRD-*
```

### lj

list jobs (default limit is 1000). Use ```-v``` for more info. Outputs a csv with ```--csv```

```
gomeme lj --application TOTO-PRD --status Executing --limit 30
gomeme lj -a TOTO-PRD --host *pk1*
```

when listing a single jobid, one can use the deps option to go through the jobs in the neighbour of that job.

```
gomeme lj --deps --jobid FOOSRV:5rxwz -v
```


### qr.set

set a qr

```
gomeme qr.set --name DEV-FOO --ctm BARCT4T --max 5
```

### job.log

get the output or logs of a job id

```
gomeme job.log --jobid FOOCCT4P:5nq1c
gomeme job.log --jobid FOOCCT4P:5nq1c --output
gomeme job.log --jobid FOOCCT4P:5nq1c --output --run 3
```

### job.order

order a job.

```
gomeme job.order --ctm FOOCT4T --folder ABC-DEV-OND --jobs dABC1
```

### job.action

hold/delete/undelete/confirm/setToOk/rerun a job

```
gomeme job.action --action delete --jobid FOOCT4T:3z553
```

### job.tree

Tries to draw a tree of jobs with their dependencies.
This generates quite a lot of queries to control-m (1 per job to retrieve dependencies),
so it must be run carefully. Ensure there is no more than 100 jobs to analyse
when running tree.

The output looks like
```
A
  B
    C
  D
E
  F
```
which means that A and E do not have known predecessor
(in the list of selected nodes) and that B must complete before C starts, A must complete
before B and D starts.

We ensure the longest chain of jobs is shown, so if all jobs take the same amount of time to complete, in above
example C should start after B finishes, but there could be dependencies not appearing, such as C depending on
the completion of D, that are not reflected.

This command takes the same parameters as lj

```
gomeme job.tree --application TOTO-PRD --limit 10
gomeme job.tree --application TOTO-PRD --limit 10 --back    # instead of following dependencies, follow predecessors
```


### curl

Just outputs the curl command to run to target the API by hand

```
gomeme curl
```

### config.servers

List all servers

```
gomeme config.servers
```

### config.agents

List all agents for a specific server

```
gomeme config.servers --ctm FOO123
```


### config.agent

List parameters specific to an agent. Uses ```--all``` to show all parameters.

```
gomeme config.server --ctm FOO123 --host toto.net
```

### config.ping

Ping an agent, so that it ends up in config.agents output. Default timeout is 10s, use d to discover.

```
gomeme config.ping -H foo -c FOO
```

### config.hostgroup

Returns the list of agents parts of a hostgroup

```
gomeme config.hostgroup -c foo -g group
```

### deploy.get

Return definition of jobs in folder

```
gomeme deploy.get --ctm FOO --folder toto --xml
gomeme deploy.get --ctm FOO --folder toto
```

### deploy.put

Upload the definition of jobs

```
gomeme deploy.put --filename foo.json --subject "Record1234" --ctm FOOCTM
```

### con

ðŸš§ List jobs on a terminal. Take the same parameters as lj

```
gomeme con
```

Supports ```/``` to search, ```s``` to get a status, ```Enter``` for job output, ```l``` for the logs...
Might need to resize the screen after these displays...

### job.get

Retrieve status, waiting info, parameters of a single job

```
gomeme job.get -j FOO:123
```

### job.modify

Change the parameters of a held job

```
gomeme job.modify  --subject "Record 1234" -n jobname -j FOOBAR:09otj -- param1 param2
```

### logout

Logout

```
gomeme logout
```
